Question 1
Summary of the Paper

In the paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," Turing discusses many objections raised by critics to the idea of artificial intelligence. A summary of the objections included is that some critics raised concerns that machines cannot be intelligent because they lack a soul. Some said that there are mathematical limitations, that machines will not be able to do certain tasks and they are beyond their capabilities. Some also said that machines do not have consciousness like humans do so they cannot really be very intelligent. Critics argued that humans are very unpredictable and their behavior can be anything so machines won't be able to mimic human behavior. They said that humans possess many characteristics such as emotions and intuition,feelings which machines cannot replicate.

Objections

When we talk about which objections still carry some weight, We can talk about the question of whether machines can ever truly possess consciousness. They can be very intelligent from the outside, but they can't really think on their own. Other than this, we can talk about human behavior. Every human being has his own personality. His own behavior. But machines can't really have that, and it still seems like a struggle to completely replicate this. Humans also rely a lot on their intuition and emotions, which are very difficult to replicate and give to a robot.

Refutations

Turing argued that machine intelligence should be based on observable behavior rather than looking inside the human. He said that instead of worrying about the theological part, mathematical limitations, or consistency, we should work on a more pragmatic and empirical approach. He emphasized that the criteria for intelligence involve comparing a human's responses with those of a machine without revealing their identities, with the goal of achieving indistinguishability. He said that if a machine should exhibit human-like behavior, that is intelligence, even if it does not have consciousness.

New objections

Since there has been a lot of development recently, some of the objections are: We are relying too much on AI for various tasks, like problem-solving. Depending excessively on AI might lead us to forget how to do things ourselves. AI is used everywhere, and it can be misused by anyone because there are no proper rules for its usage. Privacy invasion might become a problem as AI surveillance cameras are watching what people are doing. People may lose jobs as they are replaced by AI.

Prediction

Turing predicted that by 2000, there would be a 30% chance of a computer passing this test with an unskilled interrogator. I think it was reasonable for his time because it was too early in 1950 with very little technology and knowledge available then, but today it might not be fulfilled. There have been a lot of advancements in AI, such as deep learning, NLP, and machine learning, and we have achieved many things, but passing the Turing Test doesn’t just mean that machines have human-like thoughts and understanding. So this might not be the best way to evaluate AI progress.

Question 2

ping pong :
This is solvable by computers. A robot arm can befitted with a ping pong paddle and motion sensors to move to wherever the ball is. A similar model was revealed during the CES 2019 called Forpheus.

Bridge at comp level:
This is solvable by computers. There are already computers that can play chess at a competitive level, and since bridge isn’t as complicated as chess it shouldn’t be too hard for a computer.

Funny story:
It is doable to an extent, given that any AI can make jokes, even the ones on your phone that are somewhat like easter eggs. But it does have its limitations to what extent they can generate jokes or a funny story.

Legal advise:
Yes, there are existing AI's that can can give sound legal advise, a simple google search can show you a sea of exisitng legal AI models.

Theorem discovery: 
There are theorems that have discvered by AI. So yes.

Surgical operation:
this is somewhat possible, there are Ai models that are trained to detect cancer cells or to diagnose a paitient, but for Surgical procedures, Humans have to intervene.

Unload dishwasher:
Maybe possible, but might need some tweeking to make it possible without human intervention.

construct a building:
IT is somewhat possible, since AI can be used to generate designs and maybe implement them. But since gen Ai still needs more time to make perfect models based on promts, since it can still make pretty wonky stuff.

Questions 3:

The financial market is a constantly changing and complex environment where AI can help predict trends and support decision-making. Some information, like past stock prices and public financial reports, is accessible, but insider details remain private, making the environment only partially accessible. It is unpredictable because many factors, such as political events and economic shifts, can impact the market. Since decisions have long-term consequences and affect future market conditions, the environment is not episodic. Additionally, it is not static because new financial products, regulations, and trading patterns emerge regularly. Lastly, the financial market operates continuously, with real-time data requiring AI to adapt quickly to changing conditions.


Question 4:
1: True
2:true
3: False, Rationality depends on task complexity; no single agent is rational in all.
4: False
5: Falsa
6: true
7: true
